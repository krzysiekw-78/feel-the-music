# fell-the-music
Mini-project written durring the CodersLab bootcamp: a search engine for music artists (and related artists), based on the available API.
In the project I used the React library, ReactPlayer component and json-server. You can find some informations about artist and choose category to play some YouTube videos stored in the database. Navigation on the website uses React Router.
